My solution to the [Bank kata on Codurance's Katalyst](https://katalyst.codurance.com/bank), an outside-in TDD challenge.

After about an hour and a half, I could achieve a very simple, yet satisfactory solution. The three classes are short and almost 100% covered by 
unit tests.

This kata is very good at showing you how TDD is not a testing practice. Rather it's a design discipline that helps you achieve
a simple design by pushing YAGNI and a very short feedback loop.
